# Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains various algorithms and data structures implemented in Java as part of different assignments or projects. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem or algorithm with a dedicated README that explains the implementation in detail.

## Project List

1. **8puzzle**: 
   - Implementation of the 8-puzzle solver using the A* search algorithm. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles and a blank space. The objective is to move the tiles until the grid is in the correct order.

2. **Percolation**:
   - Simulates percolation in a grid system. This project helps understand percolation theory by modeling a porous material and determining whether the system percolates using a Union-Find data structure.

3. **PointSET**:
   - Implements a set of points in a 2D plane using a binary search tree (BST). It supports efficient range searching and nearest neighbor queries. The set is compared to a KdTree-based implementation, providing a simpler but less optimized approach.

4. **Kd Tree**:
   - An efficient implementation of a 2D tree structure (KdTree) for organizing points in a plane. This structure supports efficient range searches and nearest neighbor searches compared to the PointSET approach.

5. **Collinear**:
   - This project finds sets of collinear points in a 2D plane using a sorting-based approach. The implementation identifies all lines passing through 4 or more points using different algorithms, like brute force and sorting.

6. **Queues**:
   - Implements various queue data structures, including randomized queues and dequeues, demonstrating their applications in various algorithms and simulations.

## How to Use

Each folder contains its own README file detailing the problem, approach, and implementation specifics. To run a project:

1. Clone this repository:
