The Percolation problem is solved using the Union-Find algorithm, providing an efficient solution to determine whether a system percolates. To visualize the process, run the PercolationVisualizer class, which offers a graphical representation of the grid as it percolates. Additionally, the solution includes a PercolationStats class that estimates the probability of percolation by randomly opening grid cells. This class also computes the percolation threshold, offering insights into the critical point at which the system transitions from non-percolating to percolating.
